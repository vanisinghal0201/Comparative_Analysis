INTRODUCTION 
Training a machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset can introduce unique challenges to the learning problem. Imbalanced data typically refers to a classification problem where the number of observations per class is not equally distributed; often there will be a large amount of data/observations for one class (referred to as the majority class), and much fewer observations for one or more other classes (referred to as the minority classes). 
Machine Learning algorithms tend to produce unsatisfactory classifiers when faced with imbalanced datasets. For any imbalanced data set, if the event to be predicted belongs to the minority class and the event rate is less than 5%, it is usually referred to as a rare event.
